# Game: Age of Warriors++

Game developed in C++, using the SFML Library, for the Programming Technniques Course. In this game, a lot of advanced OOP concepts were used, like polymorphism, abstract classes and operator overloading.

This 2D plataform game was based in a Software Engineering's project, therefore we utilized requirements appuration and UML (Unified Modeling Language) to guide the development of our project.
